Description: CommonMark compliant and extensible Markdown parser written in Go
 goldmark is a Markdown parser written in Go.  It is easy to extend, standard
 compliant, and well structured.  It is compliant with CommonMark 0.30,
 and supports extensions from GitHub Flavored Markdown and PHP Markdown Extra.
 .
 Features:
 .
  * Standard compliant.  goldmark gets full compliance with the latest
    CommonMark spec.
  * Extensible.  Do you want to add a @username mention syntax to Markdown?
    You can easily do it in goldmark. You can add your AST nodes, parsers
    for block level elements, parsers for inline level elements,
    transformers for paragraphs, transformers for whole AST structure, and
    renderers.
  * Performance.  goldmark performs pretty much equally to cmark, the
    CommonMark reference implementation written in C.
  * Robust. goldmark is tested with go-fuzz, a fuzz testing tool.
  * Builtin extensions.  goldmark ships with common extensions like tables,
    strikethrough, task lists, and definition lists.
  * Depends only on standard libraries.
